## Ideas

#### Knative

##### Improving Wasm support in Knative Functions

- Description: Wasm aka WebAssembly provides a portable binary-code format that is ideal to write small functions. However, current support for Wasm in Knative Functions is limited and slow. This project will improve this support.
- Expected Outcome: Contribute Wasm support to Knative functions, documentation, sample code etc. Ideal outcome would be running Wasm code via Knative Functions in a convenient way. However, there are some unknowns. Other possible outcome could be identifying the roadblocks and possible improvements
- Recommended Skills: basic programming skills, use IDE and debugger, some experience with Kubernetes
- Expected project size: medium (~175 hour project)
- Mentor(s):
  - Aleksander Slominski @aslom (aslomins AT redhat DOT com)  - primary
  - Matthias Wessendorf @matzew (matzew AT redhat DOT com)
- Upstream Issue (URL): https://github.com/knative/func/discussions/1489

#### KubeArmor

##### Rancher Plugin Integration

- Description: The goal is to create an extension for Rancher, a Kubernetes management platform, which will enable interaction with KubeArmor. The extension will have the capability to install KubeArmor, allow the users to easily see the state and manage KubeArmor policies, default posture, protected containers, and provide monitoring of workload behavior through alerts and telemetry.
- Expected Outcome: Rancher plugin address the following points:
  - Install KubeArmor
  - Manage KubeArmor Security Policy Resources
  - Manage ClusterWide and Namespace Specific KubeArmor Configuration and Security Postures (Policy Decision and Visibility)
  - Handle Recommendation of Policies based on `karmor recommend`
  - Integrate KubeArmor Visibility Dashboards based on Grafana with Rancher Preset Grafana Dashboards
- Recommended Skills: Rancher, Grafana stack, Javascript
- Expected project size: Large
